## Completed Work
- Discussed with Mert and decided to separate the implementation of ML libraries. A base API class will be created, and different ML libraries will extend this base class.
- Developed the base class and implemented support for Scikit-learn (sklearn).
- Implemented the EvaluationMeasure table in the Passport backend (previously missing).

## Discussion Points
- Determine where to display evaluation measures:
  - A separate interface on passport-web?
  - Integrated into Passport?
  - Included in the monitoring platform?
- Present a demo and gather feedback.
- Assess whether the API can be extended beyond Learning Process, Learning Stage, Model, and Evaluation Measure.
- Decide if we should support ML libraries beyond sklearn, torch, and keras.

## Next Steps
- Extend and implement the base class for keras and torch.
- Once Kerem completes the ModelParameter implementation, integrate hyperparameter-to-ModelParameter methods for all supported libraries.
- Prepare a well-documented README.md for the library.
